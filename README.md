# Dtube Deployment Ansible Scripts

This repo is currently in development and *aims* to follow Ansible best practice for rapid dtube node deployment.

At present it is able to fully deploy dtube snap, upldr and saver instances.

Also can deploy a default zabbix install.

upldrg cannot be built yet.

Still far from user friendly, but sans the missing instance classes, this is very close to current prod deployment.
